## Summary of Updates

This document outlines the recent changes made to improve the JobTracker application's user experience and functionality.

---

## 1. Disabled Apply Button for Applied/Interviewing Jobs

### Change
Apply buttons are now disabled for job leads that are in "Applied" or "Interviewing" status.

### Rationale
- Prevents users from accidentally applying to the same job multiple times
- Provides visual feedback that an action has already been taken
- Button text changes to "Applied" when disabled

### Files Modified
- `/components/Dashboard.tsx`

### Implementation Details
```typescript
// Apply button now checks job status
disabled={job.status === 'applied' || job.status === 'interviewing'}

// Button text changes based on status
{job.status === 'applied' || job.status === 'interviewing' ? 'Applied' : 'Apply'}
```

## 2. Notifications Moved to Drawer

### Change
Notifications are no longer a separate tab/screen. They are now accessible via a slide-out drawer that can be opened from any screen.

### Benefits
- **Improved Accessibility**: Access notifications from anywhere in the app
- **Better UX**: No need to navigate away from current work
- **Cleaner Navigation**: Reduces main navigation clutter
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile

### Files Modified
- `/components/AppLayout.tsx` - Added notification drawer with Sheet component
- `/components/NotificationsView.tsx` - Removed padding/header for drawer display
- `/App.tsx` - Removed notifications from screen routing

### Implementation Details

#### Desktop View
- Notification button in sidebar opens drawer
- Shows unread count badge
- Full-width drawer with notifications content

#### Mobile View
- Bell icon in header opens drawer
- Compact badge shows unread count
- Full-screen drawer on mobile

## 3. Clickable Filter Cards

### Change
The statistics cards at the top of the dashboard are now clickable filters that show only jobs matching that status.

### Features
- **All Leads** - Shows all jobs (default view)
- **Saved** - Shows only saved jobs
- **Applied** - Shows only applied jobs
- **Interviewing** - Shows only jobs in interview stage
- **Offers** - Shows only jobs with offers
- **Rejected** - Shows only rejected jobs

### Visual Feedback
- **Hover Effect**: Cards show shadow on hover to indicate they're clickable
- **Active State**: Selected filter has a primary-colored ring around it
- **Cursor**: Pointer cursor on hover

### Files Modified
- `/components/Dashboard.tsx`

### Implementation Details
```typescript
// New handler for stat card clicks
const handleStatCardClick = (status: ApplicationStatus | 'all') => {
  setFilterStatus(status);
};

// Cards now have click handlers and visual states
<Card 
  className={`cursor-pointer hover:shadow-md ${
    filterStatus === 'saved' ? 'ring-2 ring-primary shadow-md' : ''
  }`}
  onClick={() => handleStatCardClick('saved')}
>
```

### User Experience
1. User clicks on a stat card (e.g., "Applied: 5")
2. Dashboard filters to show only those jobs
3. Card gets highlighted with ring border
4. Click "All Leads" to reset and see everything
5. Smooth transition between filtered views
